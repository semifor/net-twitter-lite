          for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
              print "$status->{created_at} <$status->{user}{screen_name}> $status->{text}\n";
          }
      };
      warn "$@\n" if $@;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a perl interface to the Twitter APIs. It uses the
    same API definitions as Net::Twitter, but without the extra bells and
    whistles and without the additional dependencies. Same great taste, less
    filling.

    This module is related to, but is not part of the "Net::Twitter"
    distribution. It's API methods and API method documentation are
    generated from "Net::Twitter"'s internals. It exists for those who
    cannot, or prefer not to install Moose and its dependencies.

    You should consider upgrading to "Net::Twitter" for additional
    functionality, finer grained control over features, full backwards
    compatibility with older versions of "Net::Twitter", and additional
    error handling options.

CLIENT CODE CHANGES REQUIRED
  Legacy Lists API
    Twitter re-implemented the Lists API using new endpoints and semantics.
    For backwards compatibility, this version of "Net::Twitter::Lite"
    defaults to the deprecated, legacy endpoints and semantics. It issues a
    warning if the "legacy_lists_api" option to new is not provided.

    To enable the new Lists endpoints and semantics, pass "(legacy_lists_api
    =" 0)> to "new". To disable the warning, and keep the backwards
    compatible endpoints and semantics, pass "(legacy_lists_api =" 1)> to
    "new".

    The "legacy_lists_api" option to "new" sets the default for all lists
    API method calls. You can override the default an each API call by
    passing a "-legacy_lists_api" option set to 1 or 0.

    Support for "legacy_lists_api" option will be removed in a future
    version and the option to "new" will be silently ignored.

  netrc option
    The default "apiurl" changed in version 0.08006. The change should be
    transparent to client code, unless you're using the "netrc" option. If
    so, you'll need to either update the ".netrc" entry and change the
    "machine" value from "twitter.com" to "api.twitter.com", or set either
    the "netrc" or "netrc_machine" options to "twitter.com".

        $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc_machine => 'twitter.com', netrc => 1);
        # -or-
        $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 'twitter.com');

  OAuth requires callback parameter
    Beginning with version 0.03, it is necessary for web applications using
    OAuth authentication to pass the "callback" parameter to
    "get_authorization_url". In the absence of a callback parameter, when
    the user authorizes the application a PIN number is displayed rather
    than redirecting the user back to your site.

MIGRATING FROM NET::TWITTER 2.x
    If you are migrating from Net::Twitter 2.12 (or an earlier version), you
    may need to make some minor changes to your application code in order to
    user Net::Twitter::Lite successfully.

    The primary difference is in error handling. Net::Twitter::Lite throws
    exceptions on error. It does not support the "get_error", "http_code",
    and "http_message" methods used in Net::Twitter 2.12 and prior versions.

    Instead of

      # DON'T!
      my $friends = $nt->friends();
      if ( $friends ) {
          # process $friends
      }

    wrap the API call in an eval block:

      # DO!
      my $friends = eval { $nt->friends() };
      if ( $friends ) {
          # process $friends
      }

    Here's a much more complex example taken from application code using
    Net::Twitter 2.12:

      # DON'T!
      my $friends = $nt->friends();
      if ( $friends ) {
          # process $friends
      }
      else {
          my $error = $nt->get_error;
          if ( ref $error ) {
              if ( ref($error) eq 'HASH' && exists $error->{error} ) {
                  $error = $error->{error};
              }
              else {
                  $error = 'Unexpected error type ' . ref($error);
              }
          }
          else {
              $error = $nt->http_code() . ": " . $nt->http_message;
          }
          warn "$error\n";
      }

    The Net::Twitter::Lite equivalent is:

      # DO!
      eval {
          my $friends = $nt->friends();
          # process $friends
      };
      warn "$@\n" if $@;
      return;

    In Net::Twitter::Lite, an error can always be treated as a string. See
    Net::Twitter::Lite::Error. The HTTP Status Code and HTTP Message are
    both available. Rather than accessing them via the Net::Twitter::Lite
    instance, you access them via the Net::Twitter::Lite::Error instance
    thrown as an error.

    For example:

      # DO!
      eval {
         my $friends = $nt->friends();
         # process $friends
      };
      if ( my $error = $@ ) {
          if ( blessed $error && $error->isa("Net::Twitter::Lite::Error)
               && $error->code() == 502 ) {
              $error = "Fail Whale!";
          }
          warn "$error\n";
      }

  Unsupported Net::Twitter 2.12 options to "new"
    Net::Twitter::Lite does not support the following Net::Twitter 2.12
    options to "new". It silently ignores them:

    no_fallback
        If Net::Twitter::Lite is unable to create an instance of the class
        specified in the "useragent_class" option to "new", it dies, rather
        than falling back to an LWP::UserAgent object. You really don't want
        a failure to create the "useragent_class" you specified to go
        unnoticed.

    twittervision
        Net::Twitter::Lite does not support the TwitterVision API. Use
        Net::Twitter, instead, if you need it.

    skip_arg_validation
        Net::Twitter::Lite does not API parameter validation. This is a
        feature. If Twitter adds a new option to an API method, you can use
        it immediately by passing it in the HASH ref to the API call.

        Net::Twitter::Lite relies on Twitter to validate its own parameters.
        An appropriate exception will be thrown if Twitter reports a
        parameter error.

    die_on_validation
        See "skip_arg_validation". If Twitter returns an bad parameter
        error, an appropriate exception will be thrown.

    arrayref_on_error
        This option allowed the following idiom in Net::Twitter 2.12:

          # DON'T!
          for my $friend ( @{ $nt->friends() } ) {
             # process $friend
          }

        The equivalent Net::Twitter::Lite code is:

          # DO!
          eval {
              for my $friend ( @{ $nt->friends() } ) {
                  # process $friend
              }
          };

  Unsupported Net::Twitter 2.12 methods
    clone
        The "clone" method was added to Net::Twitter 2.x to allow safe error
        handling in an environment where concurrent requests are handled,
        for example, when using LWP::UserAgent::POE as the
        "useragent_class". Since Net::Twitter::Lite throws exceptions
        instead of stashing them in the Net::Twitter::Lite instance, it is
        safe in a current request environment, obviating the need for
        "clone".

    get_error
    http_code
    http_message
        These methods are replaced by Net::Twitter::Lite::Error. An instance
        of that class is thrown errors are encountered.

METHODS AND ARGUMENTS
    new This constructs a "Net::Twitter::Lite" object. It takes several
        named parameters, all of them optional:

        username
            This is the screen name or email used to authenticate with
            Twitter. Use this option for Basic Authentication, only.

        password
            This is the password used to authenticate with Twitter. Use this
            option for Basic Authentication, only.

        consumer_key
            A string containing the OAuth consumer key provided by Twitter
            when an application is registered. Use this option for OAuth
            authentication, only.

        consumer_secret
            A string containing the OAuth consumer secret. Use this option
            for OAuth authentication, only. the "OAuth" trait is included.

        oauth_urls
            A HASH ref of URLs to be used with OAuth authentication.
            Defaults to:

              {
                  request_token_url => "http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token",
                  authorization_url => "http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize",
                  access_token_url  => "http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token",
                  xauth_url         => "https://twitter.com/oauth/access_token",
              }

        clientname
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-Name" HTTP header. It
            defaults to "Perl Net::Twitter::Lite".

        clientver
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-Version" HTTP header. It
            defaults to current version of the "Net::Twitter::Lite" module.

        clienturl
            The value for the "X-Twitter-Client-URL" HTTP header. It
            defaults to the search.cpan.org page for the
            "Net::Twitter::Lite" distribution.

        useragent_class
            The "LWP::UserAgent" compatible class used internally by
            "Net::Twitter::Lite". It defaults to "LWP::UserAgent". For POE
            based applications, consider using "LWP::UserAgent::POE".

        useragent_args
            An HASH ref of arguments to pass to constructor of the class
            specified with "useragent_class", above. It defaults to {} (an
            empty HASH ref).

        useragent
            The value for "User-Agent" HTTP header. It defaults to
            "Net::Twitter::Lite/0.11000_00 (Perl)".

        source
            The value used in the "source" parameter of API method calls. It
            is currently only used in the "update" method in the REST API.
            It defaults to "twitterpm". This results in the text "from
            Net::Twitter" rather than "from web" for status messages posted
            from "Net::Twitter::Lite" when displayed via the Twitter web
            interface. The value for this parameter is provided by Twitter
            when a Twitter application is registered. See
            <http://apiwiki.twitter.com/FAQ#HowdoIget%E2%80%9CfromMyApp%E2%8
            0%9DappendedtoupdatessentfrommyAPIapplication>.

        apiurl
            The URL for the Twitter API. This defaults to
            "http://twitter.com".

        identica
            If set to 1 (or any value that evaluates to true), apiurl
            defaults to "http://identi.ca/api".

        ssl If set to 1, an SSL connection will be used for all API calls.
            Defaults to 0.

        netrc
            (Optional) Sets the *machine* key to look up in ".netrc" to
            obtain credentials. If set to 1, Net::Twitter::Lite will use the
            value of the "netrc_machine" option (below).

               # in .netrc
               machine api.twitter.com
                 login YOUR_TWITTER_USER_NAME
                 password YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD
               machine semifor.twitter.com
                 login semifor
                 password SUPERSECRET

               # in your perl program
               $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 1);
               $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(netrc => 'semifor.twitter.com');

        netrc_machine
            (Optional) Sets the "machine" entry to look up in ".netrc" when
            "<netrc =" 1>> is used. Defaults to "api.twitter.com".

        legacy_lists_api
            If set to 1, this option enables backwards compatibility by
            using the now deprecated endpoints and semantics for lists API
            methods. If set to 0, the new endpoints and semantics will be
            used. Only the new lists API methods are documented here.

            If you do not provide this option to "new" a warning is issued.
            Support for this option and the legacy lists API methods will be
            removed in a future version.

  BASIC AUTHENTICATION METHODS
    credentials($username, $password)
        Set the credentials for Basic Authentication. This is helpful for
        managing multiple accounts.

  OAUTH METHODS
    authorized
        Whether the client has the necessary credentials to be authorized.

        Note that the credentials may be wrong and so the request may fail.

    request_access_token
        Returns list including the access token, access token secret,
        user_id, and screen_name for this user. Takes a HASH of arguments.
        The "verifier" argument is required. See "OAUTH EXAMPLES".

        The user must have authorized this app at the url given by
        "get_authorization_url" first.

        For desktop applications, the Twitter authorization page will
        present the user with a PIN number. Prompt the user for the PIN
        number, and pass it as the "verifier" argument to
        request_access_token.

        Returns the access token and access token secret but also sets them
        internally so that after calling this method, you can immediately
        call API methods requiring authentication.

    get_authorization_url(callback => $callback_url)
        Get the URL used to authorize the user. Returns a "URI" object. For
        web applications, pass your applications callback URL as the
        "callback" parameter. No arguments are required for desktop
        applications ("callback" defaults to "oob", out-of-band).

    get_authentication_url(callback => $callback_url)
        Get the URL used to authenticate the user with "Sign in with
        Twitter" authentication flow. Returns a "URI" object. For web
        applications, pass your applications callback URL as the "callback"
        parameter. No arguments are required for desktop applications
        ("callback" defaults to "oob", out-of-band).

    xauth($username, $password)
        Exchanges a username and password for OAuth tokens. Your application
        must be approved for XAuth access by Twitter for this method to
        work. Twitter does not grant XAuth access for web applications
        except for a brief period of time to allow them to switch form Basic
        authentication to OAuth authentication.

    access_token
        Get or set the access token.

    access_token_secret
        Get or set the access token secret.

    request_token
        Get or set the request token.

    request_token_secret
        Get or set the request token secret.

    access_token_url
        Get or set the access_token URL.

    authentication_url
        Get or set the authentication URL.

    authorization_url
        Get or set the authorization URL.

    request_token_url
        Get or set the request_token URL.

    xauth_url
        Get or set the XAuth access token request URL.

API METHODS AND ARGUMENTS
    Most Twitter API methods take parameters. All Net::Twitter::Lite API
    methods will accept a HASH ref of named parameters as specified in the
    Twitter API documentation. For convenience, many Net::Twitter::Lite
    methods accept simple positional arguments as documented, below. The
    positional parameter passing style is optional; you can always use the
    named parameters in a hash ref if you prefer.

    For example, the REST API method "update" has one required parameter,
    "status". You can call "update" with a HASH ref argument:

        $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!' });

    Or, you can use the convenient form:

        $nt->update('Hello world!');

    The "update" method also has an optional parameter,
    "in_reply_to_status_id". To use it, you must use the HASH ref form:

        $nt->update({ status => 'Hello world!', in_reply_to_status_id => $reply_to });

    Convenience form is provided for the required parameters of all API
    methods. So, these two calls are equivalent:

        $nt->friendship_exists({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });
        $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);

    Many API methods have aliases. You can use the API method name, or any
    of its aliases, as you prefer. For example, these calls are all
    equivalent:

        $nt->friendship_exists($fred, $barney);
        $nt->relationship_exists($fred, $barney);
        $nt->follows($fred, $barney);

    Aliases support both the HASH ref and convenient forms:

        $nt->follows({ user_a => $fred, user_b => $barney });

    Methods that support the "page" parameter expect page numbers > 0.
    Twitter silently ignores invalid "page" values. So "{ page => 0 }"
    produces the same result as "{ page => 1 }".

    In addition to the arguments specified for each API method described
    below, an additional "authenticate" parameter can be passed. To request
    an "Authorization" header, pass "authenticated => 1"; to suppress an
    authentication header, pass "authentication => 0". Even if requested, an
    Authorization header will not be added if there are no user credentials
    (username and password for Basic Authentication; access tokens for
    OAuth).

    This is probably only useful for the "rate_limit_status" method in the
    REST API, since it returns different values for an authenticated and a
    non-authenticated call.

REST API Methods
    Several of these methods accept a user ID as the "id" parameter. The
    user ID can be either a screen name, or the users numeric ID. To
    disambiguate, use the "screen_name" or "user_id" parameters, instead.

    For example, These calls are equivalent:

        $nt->create_friend('perl_api');    # screen name
        $nt->create_friend(1564061);       # numeric ID
        $nt->create_friend({ id => 'perl_api' });
        $nt->create_friend({ screen_name => 'perl_api' });
        $nt->create_friend({ user_id     => 1564061 });

    However user_id 911 and screen_name 911 are separate Twitter accounts.
    These calls are NOT equivalent:

        $nt->create_friend(911); # interpreted as screen name
        $nt->create_friend({ user_id => 911 }); # screen name: richellis

    Whenever the "id" parameter is required and "user_id" and "screen_name"
    are also parameters, using any one of them satisfies the requirement.

    account_settings

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the current trend, geo and sleep time information for the
        authenticating user.

        Returns: HashRef

    account_totals

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the current count of friends, followers, updates (statuses)
        and favorites of the authenticating user.

        Returns: HashRef

    add_list_member

        Parameters: list_id, slug, user_id, screen_name, owner_screen_name,
        owner_id
        Required: *none*

        Add a member to a list. The authenticated user must own the list to
        be able to add members to it. Note that lists can't have more than
        500 members.

        Returns: User

    add_place
    add_place(name, contained_within, token, lat, long)

        Parameters: name, contained_within, token, lat, long,
        attribute:street_address, callback
        Required: name, contained_within, token, lat, long

        Creates a new place object at the given latitude and longitude.

        Before creating a place you need to query "similar_places" with the
        latitude, longitude and name of the place you wish to create. The
        query will return an array of places which are similar to the one
        you wish to create, and a token. If the place you wish to create
        isn't in the returned array you can use the token with this method
        to create a new one.

        Returns: Place

    alias: all_lists
    alias: list_subscriptions

        Parameters: user_id, screen_name, count, cursor
        Required: *none*

        Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes
        to, including their own. The user is specified using the user_id or
        screen_name parameters. If no user is given, the authenticating user
        is used.

        Returns: ArrayRef[List]

    block_exists
    block_exists(id)

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name, include_entities
        Required: id

        Returns if the authenticating user is blocking a target user. Will
        return the blocked user's object if a block exists, and error with
        HTTP 404 response code otherwise.

        Returns: BasicUser

    blocking

        Parameters: page, include_entities
        Required: *none*

        Returns an array of user objects that the authenticating user is
        blocking.

        Returns: ArrayRef[BasicUser]

    blocking_ids

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns an array of numeric user ids the authenticating user is
        blocking.

    followers_ids
    followers_ids(id)

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name, cursor
        Required: id

        Returns a reference to an array of numeric IDs for every user
        following the specified user. The order of the IDs may change from
        call to call. To obtain the screen names, pass the arrayref to
        "lookup_users".

        Use the optional "cursor" parameter to retrieve IDs in pages of
        5000. When the "cursor" parameter is used, the return value is a
        reference to a hash with keys "previous_cursor", "next_cursor", and
        "ids". The value of "ids" is a reference to an array of IDS of the
        user's followers. Set the optional "cursor" parameter to -1 to get
        the first page of IDs. Set it to the prior return's value of
        "previous_cursor" or "next_cursor" to page forward or backwards.
        When there are no prior pages, the value of "previous_cursor" will
        be 0. When there are no subsequent pages, the value of "next_cursor"
        will be 0.

    friends
    alias: following

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name, cursor, include_entities
        Required: *none*

        Returns a reference to an array of the user's friends. If "id",
        "user_id", or "screen_name" is not specified, the friends of the
        authenticating user are returned. The returned users are ordered
        from most recently followed to least recently followed.

        Use the optional "cursor" parameter to retrieve users in pages of
        100. When the "cursor" parameter is used, the return value is a
        reference to a hash with keys "previous_cursor", "next_cursor", and
        "users". The value of "users" is a reference to an array of the
        user's friends. The result set isn't guaranteed to be 100 every time
        as suspended users will be filtered out. Set the optional "cursor"
        parameter to -1 to get the first page of users. Set it to the prior
        return's value of "previous_cursor" or "next_cursor" to page forward
        or backwards. When there are no prior pages, the value of
        "previous_cursor" will be 0. When there are no subsequent pages, the
        value of "next_cursor" will be 0.

        Returns: Hashref|ArrayRef[User]

    friends_ids
    friends_ids(id)
    alias: following_ids

        Parameters: id, user_id, screen_name, cursor
        Required: id

        Returns a reference to an array of numeric IDs for every user
        followed by the specified user. The order of the IDs is reverse
        chronological.

        Use the optional "cursor" parameter to retrieve IDs in pages of
        5000. When the "cursor" parameter is used, the return value is a
        reference to a hash with keys "previous_cursor", "next_cursor", and
        "ids". The value of "ids" is a reference to an array of IDS of the
        user's friends. Set the optional "cursor" parameter to -1 to get the
        first page of IDs. Set it to the prior return's value of
        "previous_cursor" or "next_cursor" to page forward or backwards.
        When there are no prior pages, the value of "previous_cursor" will
        be 0. When there are no subsequent pages, the value of "next_cursor"
        will be 0.

        Returns: HashRef|ArrayRef[Int]

    friendship_exists
    friendship_exists(user_a, user_b)
    alias: relationship_exists
    alias: follows

        Parameters: user_id_a, user_id_b, screen_name_a, screen_name_b,
        user_a, user_b
        Required: user_a, user_b

        Tests for the existence of friendship between two users. Will return
        true if user_a follows user_b, otherwise will return false.

        Use of "user_a" and "user_b" is deprecated. It has been preserved
        for backwards compatibility, and is used for the two-argument
        positional form:

            $nt->friendship_exists($user_a, $user_b);

        Instead, you should use one of the named argument forms:

            $nt->friendship_exists({ user_id_a => $id1, user_id_b => $id2 });
            $nt->friendship_exists({ screen_name_a => $name1, screen_name_b => $name2 });

        Consider using "show_friendship" instead.

        Returns: Bool

    friendships_incoming
    friendships_incoming(cursor)

        Parameters: cursor
        Required: cursor

        Returns an HASH ref with an array of numeric IDs in the "ids"
        element for every user who has a pending request to follow the
        authenticating user.

        Returns: HashRef

    friendships_outgoing
    friendships_outgoing(cursor)

        Parameters: cursor
        Required: cursor

        Returns an HASH ref with an array of numeric IDs in the "ids"
        element for every protected user for whom the authenticating user
        has a pending follow request.

        Returns: HashRef

    geo_id
    geo_id(id)

        Parameters: id
        Required: id

        Returns details of a place returned from the "reverse_geocode"
        method.

        Returns: HashRef

    geo_search

        Parameters: lat, long, query, ip, granularity, accuracy,
        max_results, contained_within, attribute:street_address, callback
        Required: *none*

        Search for places that can be attached to a statuses/update. Given a
        latitude and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this
        request will return a list of all the valid places that can be used
        as the place_id when updating a status.

        Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve
        a list of places, have the user validate the location he or she is
        at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to
        statuses/update.

        This is the recommended method to use find places that can be
        attached to statuses/update. Unlike geo/reverse_geocode which
        provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order
        places with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach
        is also preferred for interactive place matching with the user.

        Returns: HashRef

    get_configuration

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the current configuration used by Twitter including

        loaded, but no more than once a day.

        Returns: HashRef

    get_languages

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the list of languages supported by Twitter along with their

        either ID, screen name, or combination of the two. The author's most
        recent status (if the authenticating user has permission) will be
        returned inline. This method is rate limited to 1000 calls per hour.

        This method will accept user IDs or screen names as either a comma
        delimited string, or as an ARRAY ref. It will also accept arguments
        in the normal HASHREF form or as a simple list of named arguments.
        I.e., any of the following forms are acceptable:

            $nt->lookup_users({ user_id => '1234,6543,3333' });

        Required: *none*

        Adds multiple members to a list, by specifying a reference to an
        array or a comma-separated list of member ids or screen names. The
        authenticated user must own the list to be able to add members to
        it. Note that lists can't have more than 500 members, and you are
        limited to adding up to 100 members to a list at a time with this
        method.

        Returns: List

    members_destroy_all
    alias: remove_list_members

        Parameters: list_id, slug, user_id, screen_name, owner_screen_name,
        owner_id
        Required: *none*

        Removes multiple members from a list, by specifying a reference to
        an array of member ids or screen names, or a string of comma
        separated user ids or screen names. The authenticated user must own
        the list to be able to remove members from it. Note that lists can't
        have more than 500 members, and you are limited to removing up to
        100 members to a list at a time with this method.

        Please note that there can be issues with lists that rapidly remove
        and add memberships. Take care when using these methods such that
        you are not too rapidly switching between removals and adds on the
        same list.

        Returns: List

    mentions
    alias: replies

        Parameters: since_id, max_id, count, page, trim_user, include_rts,
        include_entities
        Required: *none*

        Returns the 20 most recent mentions (statuses containing @username)
        for the authenticating user.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    new_direct_message
    new_direct_message(user, text)

        Parameters: user, text, screen_name, user_id, include_entities
        Required: user, text

        Sends a new direct message to the specified user from the
        authenticating user. Requires both the user and text parameters.
        Returns the sent message when successful. In order to support
        numeric screen names, the "screen_name" or "user_id" parameters may
        be used instead of "user".

        Returns: DirectMessage

    no_retweet_ids

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns an ARRAY ref of user IDs for which the authenticating user
        does not want to receive retweets.

        Returns: ArrayRef[UserIDs]

    public_timeline

        Parameters: skip_user, trim_user, include_entities
        Required: *none*

        Returns the 20 most recent statuses from non-protected users who
        have set a custom user icon. Does not require authentication. Note
        that the public timeline is cached for 60 seconds so requesting it
        more often than that is a waste of resources.

        If user credentials are provided, "public_timeline" calls are
        authenticated, so they count against the authenticated user's rate
        limit. Use "->public_timeline({ authenticate => 0 })" to make an
        unauthenticated call which will count against the calling IP
        address' rate limit, instead.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Status]

    rate_limit_status

        Parameters: *none*
        Required: *none*

        Returns the remaining number of API requests available to the
        authenticated user before the API limit is reached for the current
        hour.

        Use "->rate_limit_status({ authenticate => 0 })" to force an
        unauthenticated call, which will return the status for the IP
        address rather than the authenticated user. (Note: for a web

    reverse_geocode
    reverse_geocode(lat, long)

        Parameters: lat, long, accuracy, granularity, max_results
        Required: lat, long

        Search for places (cities and neighborhoods) that can be attached to
        a statuses/update. Given a latitude and a longitude, return a list
        of all the valid places that can be used as a place_id when updating
        a status. Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's
        location, retrieve a list of places, have the user validate the
        location he or she is at, and then send the ID of this location up
        with a call to statuses/update.

        There are multiple granularities of places that can be returned --
        "neighborhoods", "cities", etc. At this time, only United States
        data is available through this method.

        lat Required. The latitude to query about. Valid ranges are -90.0 to
            +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive.

        long
            Required. The longitude to query about. Valid ranges are -180.0
            to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive.

        accuracy
            Optional. A hint on the "region" in which to search. If a
            number, then this is a radius in meters, but it can also take a
            string that is suffixed with ft to specify feet. If this is not
            passed in, then it is assumed to be 0m. If coming from a device,
            in practice, this value is whatever accuracy the device has
            measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS, WiFi
            triangulation, etc.).

        granularity
            Optional. The minimal granularity of data to return. If this is
            not passed in, then "neighborhood" is assumed. "city" can also
            be passed.

        max_results
            Optional. A hint as to the number of results to return. This
            does not guarantee that the number of results returned will
            equal max_results, but instead informs how many "nearby" results
            to return. Ideally, only pass in the number of places you intend
            to display to the user here.

        Returns: HashRef

        Returns extended information of a given user, specified by ID or
        screen name as per the required id parameter. This information
        includes design settings, so third party developers can theme their
        widgets according to a given user's preferences. You must be
        properly authenticated to request the page of a protected user.

        Returns: ExtendedUser

    similar_places
    similar_places(lat, long, name)

        Parameters: lat, long, name, contained_within,
        attribute:street_address, callback
        Required: lat, long, name

        Locates places near the given coordinates which are similar in name.

        Conceptually you would use this method to get a list of known places
        to choose from first. Then, if the desired place doesn't exist, make
        a request to "add_place" to create a new one.

        The token contained in the response is the token needed to be able
        to create a new place.

        Returns: HashRef

        Yahoo! Where On Earth ID
        <http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/>) and some other
        human-readable information such as a the location's canonical name
        and country.

        When the optional "lat" and "long" parameters are passed, the
        available trend locations are sorted by distance from that location,
        nearest to farthest.

        Use the WOEID returned in the location object to query trends for a
        specific location.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Location]

        trending topic, the query parameter that can be used to search for
        the topic on Search, and the direct URL that can be issued against
        Search. This information is cached for five minutes, and therefore
        users are discouraged from querying these endpoints faster than once
        every five minutes. Global trends information is also available from
        this API by using a WOEID of 1.

        Returns: ArrayRef[Trend]

    trends_weekly

        Required: status

        Updates the authenticating user's status. Requires the status
        parameter specified. A status update with text identical to the
        authenticating user's current status will be ignored.

        status
            Required. The text of your status update. URL encode as
            necessary. Statuses over 140 characters will cause a 403 error

            where username is the author of the referenced tweet, within the
            update.

        lat Optional. The location's latitude that this tweet refers to. The
            valid ranges for latitude is -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive)

            The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0 to +180.0 (East is
            positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored if outside
            that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled,
            or if there not a corresponding lat parameter with this tweet.

        place_id
            Optional. The place to attach to this status update. Valid
            place_ids can be found by querying "reverse_geocode".

        display_coordinates
            Optional. By default, geo-tweets will have their coordinates
            exposed in the status object (to remain backwards compatible
            with existing API applications). To turn off the display of the
            precise latitude and longitude (but keep the contextual location
            information), pass "display_coordinates =" 0> on the status
            update.

        file. If $filename is not provided, the basename portion of $file is
        used. If $mime_type is not provided, it will be provided
        automatically using LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type().

        $raw_image_data can be provided, rather than opening a file, by
        passing "undef" as the first array value.

        Returns: ExtendedUser

    update_with_media
    update_with_media(status, media)

        Parameters: status, media[], possibly_sensitive,

          [ $file, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type ]
          [ undef, $filename, Content_Type => $mime_type, Content => $raw_image_data ]

        The first value of the array ($file) is the name of a file to open.
        The second value ($filename) is the name given to Twitter for the
        file. If $filename is not provided, the basename portion of $file is
        used. If $mime_type is not provided, it will be provided
        automatically using LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type().

        $raw_image_data can be provided, rather than opening a file, by
        passing "undef" as the first array value.

        The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which
        will reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If
        the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the tweet
        will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error.

        Returns: Status

ERROR HANDLING
    When "Net::Twitter::Lite" encounters a Twitter API error or a network
    error, it throws a "Net::Twitter::Lite::Error" object. You can catch and
    process these exceptions by using "eval" blocks and testing $@:

        eval {
            my $statuses = $nt->friends_timeline(); # this might die!

            for my $status ( @$statuses ) {
                #...
            }
        };
        if ( $@ ) {
            # friends_timeline encountered an error

            if ( blessed $@ && $@->isa('Net::Twitter::Lite::Error' ) {
                #... use the thrown error obj
                warn $@->error;
            }
            else {
                # something bad happened!
                die $@;
            }
        }

    "Net::Twitter::Lite::Error" stringifies to something reasonable, so if
    you don't need detailed error information, you can simply treat $@ as a
    string:

        eval { $nt->update($status) };
        if ( $@ ) {
            warn "update failed because: $@\n";
        }

AUTHENTICATION
    Net::Twitter::Lite currently supports both Basic Authentication and
    OAuth. The choice of authentication strategies is determined by the
    options passed to "new" or the use of the "credentials" method. An error
    will be thrown if options for both strategies are provided.

  BASIC AUTHENTICATION
    To use Basic Authentication, pass the "username" and "password" options
    to "new", or call "credentials" to set them. When Basic Authentication
    is used, the "Authorization" header is set on each authenticated API
    call.

  OAUTH AUTHENTICATION
    To use OAuth authentication, pass the "consumer_key" and
    "consumer_secret" options to new.

    Net::OAuth::Simple must be installed in order to use OAuth and an error
    will be thrown if OAuth is attempted without it. Net::Twitter::Lite does
    not *require* Net::OAuth::Simple, making OAuth an optional feature.

  OAUTH EXAMPLES
    See the "examples" directory included in this distribution for full
    working examples using OAuth.

    Here's how to authorize users as a desktop app mode:

      use Net::Twitter::Lite;

      my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(
          consumer_key    => "YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY",
          consumer_secret => "YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET",
      );

      # You'll save the token and secret in cookie, config file or session database
      my($access_token, $access_token_secret) = restore_tokens();
      if ($access_token && $access_token_secret) {
          $nt->access_token($access_token);
          $nt->access_token_secret($access_token_secret);
      }

      unless ( $nt->authorized ) {
          # The client is not yet authorized: Do it now
          print "Authorize this app at ", $nt->get_authorization_url, " and enter the PIN#\n";

          my $pin = <STDIN>; # wait for input
          chomp $pin;

          my($access_token, $access_token_secret, $user_id, $screen_name) =
              $nt->request_access_token(verifier => $pin);
          save_tokens($access_token, $access_token_secret); # if necessary
      }

      # Everything's ready

    In a web application mode, you need to save the oauth_token and
    oauth_token_secret somewhere when you redirect the user to the OAuth
    authorization URL.

      sub twitter_authorize : Local {
          my($self, $c) = @_;

          my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
          my $url = $nt->get_authorization_url(callback => $callbackurl);

          $c->response->cookies->{oauth} = {
              value => {
                  token => $nt->request_token,
                  token_secret => $nt->request_token_secret,
              },
          };

          $c->response->redirect($url);
      }

    And when the user returns back, you'll reset those request token and
    secret to upgrade the request token to access token.

      sub twitter_auth_callback : Local {
          my($self, $c) = @_;

          my %cookie = $c->request->cookies->{oauth}->value;

          my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
          $nt->request_token($cookie{token});
          $nt->request_token_secret($cookie{token_secret});
          my $verifier = $c->req->param->{oauth_verifier};

          my($access_token, $access_token_secret, $user_id, $screen_name) =
              $nt->request_access_token(verifier => $verifier);

          # Save $access_token and $access_token_secret in the database associated with $c->user
      }

    Later on, you can retrieve and reset those access token and secret
    before calling any Twitter API methods.

      sub make_tweet : Local {
          my($self, $c) = @_;

          my($access_token, $access_token_secret) = ...;

          my $nt = Net::Twitter::Lite->new(%param);
          $nt->access_token($access_token);
          $nt->access_token_secret($access_token_secret);

          # Now you can call any Net::Twitter::Lite API methods on $nt
          my $status = $c->req->param('status');
          my $res = $nt->update({ status => $status });
      }
